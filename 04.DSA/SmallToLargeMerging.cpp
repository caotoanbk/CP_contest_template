// What is it?
// Small-to-Large is a clever technique used to solve subtree-based problems on trees where you maintain some data (like color counts, frequency maps, sets, etc.) for each subtree.

// Itâ€™s commonly known as DSU on Tree because it's inspired by Disjoint Set Union logic â€” always merge smaller sets into larger ones to keep operations fast.

// âœ… When to Use
// You need to compute information for each nodeâ€™s subtree.

// Example:

// Count how many distinct colors exist in the subtree of each node.

// Compute frequency of a certain value in each nodeâ€™s subtree.

// Find the mode color in each nodeâ€™s subtree.

// ðŸ§  Why it Works
// If you always merge the smaller subtree's data into the larger, then the total number of merges over the whole tree is O(N log N).

// So your complex queries (e.g., maintaining maps, multisets) stay efficient.
//  Example Problem
// You are given a tree with N nodes. Each node has a color.
// For every node, compute how many distinct colors are present in its subtree.

// This is a classic problem that DSU on Tree solves in O(N log N) time.
